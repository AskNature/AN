# AskNature Redux

### [asknatu.re](http://asknatu.re)

## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the AskNatu.re project.  The bulk of the code needed to run http://www.asknatu.re is written in Node.js and is made available to anyone for re-use, repurposing or for improvement. The code has been under development since early 2015, and is intended as a ground-up replacement for http://www.asknature.org, a PHP/Symfony application originally developed in 2007-08. This rebuild is still in its early stages, and there is still much to be done. For the time being, our small internal team is recreating the core functions and features existing AskNature users have come to expect. But in the near future we'll transition into an ongoing, iterative, and open process of feature improvement, code refactoring, and performance improvements. If you see something you like, please feel free to share it and reuse it in your own projects. If you see something that could be improved, help us fix it or join the discussion on GitHub.
